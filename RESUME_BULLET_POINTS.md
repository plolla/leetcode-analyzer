# LeetCode Analysis Platform - Resume Bullet Points

## 9 Strong Resume Bullet Points

**1. Full-Stack AI-Powered Platform with Resilient Architecture**
• Built production LeetCode analyzer with React 18/TypeScript and Python FastAPI using Kiro AI IDE, engineered fault-tolerant dual-provider system (Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5-mini) with automatic failover and retry logic for <10s response times

**2. High-Performance Backend Design**
• Built scalable FastAPI backend with 10+ req/min rate limiting, SQLAlchemy ORM, and APScheduler cleanup service, maintaining <2s average response time under concurrent load with comprehensive error handling

**3. Intelligent Code Analysis Engine**
• Developed multi-modal AI analysis with solution completeness detection, strategic hints, time complexity evaluation, and debugging assistance, reducing manual code review time from 30+ minutes to <10 seconds

**4. Advanced Frontend Engineering**
• Designed UI/UX with Figma and implemented responsive SPA with Monaco Editor supporting 4+ languages, client-side caching reducing API calls by 40%, keyboard shortcuts, and optimistic UI updates for seamless user experience

**5. Web Scraping & Data Pipeline**
• Built robust LeetCode parser using BeautifulSoup with regex URL validation, metadata extraction, and intelligent caching layer, enabling seamless problem import without manual data entry

**6. Production DevOps & Deployment**
• Deployed microservices to Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend) with CI/CD pipelines, environment-based config, CORS security, comprehensive logging, and zero-downtime deployment strategy

**7. Database Design & Optimization**
• Designed SQLite schema with SQLAlchemy ORM implementing efficient indexing, query optimization, and automated 7-day rolling retention policy for persistent solution history tracking

**8. Prompt Engineering & AI Optimization**
• Crafted sophisticated prompt engineering system with structured output parsing and token optimization strategies, reducing AI API costs to $5-10/month while maintaining high-quality analysis results

**9. User Experience & Performance Optimization**
• Enhanced performance through strategic client-side caching, lazy loading, and responsive Tailwind CSS design, achieving 60% workflow efficiency improvement and seamless mobile experience

## Tips for Using These Bullets

1. **Pick 3-5 bullets** that best match the job description
2. **Customize keywords** to match the specific role (e.g., add "Kubernetes" if they mention it)
3. **Lead with impact** - notice how each bullet starts with strong action verbs
4. **Include metrics** - response times, uptime, cost savings, efficiency gains
5. **Show technical depth** - specific technologies, patterns, and practices
6. **Demonstrate ownership** - "Architected," "Engineered," "Designed" show leadership
