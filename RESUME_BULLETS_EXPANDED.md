# LeetCode Analyzer - Expanded Resume Bullet Points

## Bullet Points (Optimized to Fill Second Line)

• Designed and built production LeetCode analyzer with React 18/TypeScript frontend and Python FastAPI backend using Kiro AI IDE, engineered fault-tolerant dual-provider AI system (Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5-mini) with abstract factory pattern, automatic failover mechanism, and Tenacity retry logic for <10s response times

• Developed multi-modal AI analysis system with solution completeness detection, strategic hint generation with progressive difficulty levels, time complexity evaluation, and debugging assistance with actionable feedback, reducing manual code review time from 30+ minutes to <10 seconds

• Designed UI/UX with Figma and implemented responsive SPA with Monaco Editor supporting 5+ programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go), client-side caching reducing API calls by 40%, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter for analysis), and optimistic UI updates for seamless user experience
