# Frontend Production Environment Variables
# These are optional - only needed if you want to configure API URL via env var

# Backend API URL (update after deploying backend to Render)
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com

# Note: Vite only exposes variables prefixed with VITE_
# If you don't use env vars, you can hardcode the API URL in your code
